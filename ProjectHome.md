  * Balls have varied sizes/masses and behave the laws of physics in their collisions.
  * Vertical and horizontal walls.
  * Swing based, with sound effects.
  * Code is embarrassing.
  * Nieces and nephews like it.

## Version 2 ##

GUI by [Processing](http://processing.org/)

  * In experimentation phase.
  * Arbitrary angled walls; use drag/swipe movement to create.
  * Walls come in twos, like original.
  * Using JBox2D (http://www.jbox2d.org/) physics engine.
  * End goal is to play on Android phone.
  * NOTE: **JBox2D source is made available under the zlib license, not Apache 2.0.**  I'm starting out BBv2 by extending/modifying the source directly for convenience, but eventually I'll use it as a library only.
